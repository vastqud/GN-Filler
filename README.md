# Notes about the program

It’s not intended to automatically do all of the work for you immediately; it’s just to significantly reduce the time it takes to fill out the notes and eliminate the tedium of copying from the slides. You will still have to do some work before you run the program and after, but it’s nothing compared to just doing the notes on your own. The program handles the bulk of the work for you.

# Before running the program
Download the slides as a .txt file. You can do this by opening the slides from Google classroom, downloading as a .pptx presentation, uploading that to Google Slides, then download that as a .txt file from Google Slides. This is the ‘notes file’. You also have to download the worksheet as a .txt file. 

In the notes file, delete any extra text. Things like the introduction slides and sources and credits at the bottom. At the top of the file, delete everything before the first header that you have to fill out in the worksheet. At the end, delete everything after the last piece of information you have to fill out. Don’t worry about deleting empty space or lines that only include numbers, the program handles that for you.

The biggest thing you have to do before running the program is to make sure the worksheet and the notes file match. If headers are spelled differently at all, edit the notes file to make them match. For example, if a section in the worksheet is titled “Flowers + Stems”, and in the notes file that section is titled “Flowers & Stems”, replace every instance of the header “Flowers & Stems” with “Flowers + Stems” in the notes file. Even if it seems like a small difference, the program cannot detect spelling mismatches. Capitalization does not matter.

Before running the program, you must have Java installed on your computer. You can download Java here:

# Running the program
Navigate to the folder that you installed the script to. Inside that folder, shift-right-click to bring up the context menu and select ‘open Powershell window here’. Alternatively, you can open the command terminal and type ‘cd path\to\file’.

Type ‘java pptxreader.java’ to start the script. It will ask for input on the notes file, worksheet file, and an empty output file. Type or paste the file path to each file that it asks for. The output file is just a blank .txt file that it will write the result to. After you give it all the file paths, the program will start and it should fill out the output.txt file within a few seconds. This is the completed guiding notes.

# After
To import into the Google Doc classroom assignment, delete everything that’s already in the Google Doc. Then click File > Import > Upload and upload the output.txt file. 

After you have imported the file, read over it and check for any errors. The program is not perfect and sometimes there will be formatting errors (like when it doesn’t detect the end of a section). If there are consistent errors and things are out of place, try editing the notes file to better fit the worksheet file and try again. It should be easy for you, as a human, to catch any errors and fix them. The program cannot do such deep thinking. As stated previously, the program is only intended to do the bulk of the work for you; you may have to read over the output and fix it yourself but that is much better than tediously pasting from the slides and formatting the document yourself.

After you have corrected any errors, go through and paraphrase some lines, delete some lines, anything you have to do to add variation. Keep in mind that the program adds every line from the PowerPoint into the correct section in the worksheet. In the original worksheet, not every line must be filled out. You may want to delete these excess lines. The program generates nearly the same output for everyone who uses it, so it’s up to the end users to introduce variation. Variation is important because it makes detecting the use of a program impossible and deters any accusations of cheating.
