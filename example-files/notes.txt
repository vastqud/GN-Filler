Plant Systems

Functions of Plant Parts

Roots
Are typically underground
Are responsible for anchoring the plant 
Are responsible for absorption of water and nutrients

Roots
Provide physical support for the stem
Serve as food storage organs
Are used as a means of propagation in some plants
Propagation:
process of producing new plants by seeds, cuttings or other techniques

Stems
Are also known as the vascular system of the plant
Support leaves, flowers and fruit
Are used for transportation of water and nutrients
Can grow underground, along the ground and aboveground

Leaves
Absorb light energy to produce plant sugar
Provide surface area to gather more light for photosynthesis 
allows maximum light to be captured with minimum water loss

Flowers

produces seed to continue species

Flowers
Contain fragrance and color which are important factors of reproduction
attracts pollinators such as insects and animals which carry pollen to other flowers in order to continue the species

Fruit
Are fertilized or mature ovules known as seeds
Attracts insects and animals which feed on fruits, spreading the seed over a vast area of land mainly by defecation following digestion
Provides food for:
insects
humans
animals

Seeds

Plant Biology

Photosynthesis
Is a process in plants which converts light energy to chemical energy
requires light energy, CO2 and H2O
occurs in the chloroplasts

Photosynthesis
Carbon Dioxide + Water ü°™ Glucose + Oxygen 
6CO2+6H2O ü°™ C6H12O6+6O2
Allows plants to make their own food and convert it to energy

The Photosynthesis Process includes the following steps:
CO2 enters leaf through stomata
CO2 combines with energy and water in chloroplasts to make glucose
sugar moves through the leaves, then to the roots, stems and fruits of the plant
sugar is then:
used immediately for energy
stored as starch
built into plant tissue


Respiration
Is the breakdown of glucose molecules to release energy
Occurs after photosynthesis
the organism transforms the chemical energy into a form which is usable by the organism
included in photosynthesis cycle

Respiration
Glucose + Oxygen ü°™ Carbon Dioxide + Water
C6H12O6+6O2 ü°™ 6CO2+6H2O

Photosynthesis Cycle
Included on the slide is an illustration depicting process of Photosynthesis cycle. The cycle begins with the Sun‚Äôs energy and continues as follows:
Solar energy is absorbed into the leaf of the plant. 
Carbon Dioxide is absorbed into the leaf and Oxygen is Expelled.
Glucose is moved into the stem of the plant.
The root system absorbs water and Mineral Salts for nutrition of the plant. 

The Nitrogen Cycle

nitrogen contained in the atmosphere or soil goes through many chemical and biological changes, is combined into living and non-living material and returns back to the soil or air
nitrate is a very important form of nitrogen for plants

The Nitrogen Cycle
Included on the slide is an illustration depicting the Nitrogen Cycle. The cycle steps are as follows:
Nitrogen in the atmosphere is ‚Äúfixed‚Äù by bacteria in the soil to be usable by plants. 
Nitrogen in animal proteins, decaying matter, and waste is absorbed by the soil and then broken down by the bacteria to be usable nutrients for the root system of plants to absorb. 
Excess Nitrogen is expelled by plants and animals back into the atmosphere. 

Nitrate
Is the form of Nitrogen plants need to grow, develop and produce seeds
Can affect surface and groundwater quality

Nitrate

Phototropism
Included on the slide is an illustration of Phototropism or the response of a plant 
to light. The cycle begins with the Sun‚Äôs energy and continues as follows:
In the plant‚Äôs stem auxins are released on the dark side of the shoot
Auxins cause elongation of the cells within the stem. 
The plant stem then leans toward the sunlight in order to maximize the plant‚Äôs surface area that can absorb light. 


Phototropism

Is not apparent in stems
Allows roots to more easily access nutrients needed by the plant

Chemotropism
Is a positive response
roots tend to grow towards mineral ions needed by the plant
when a higher concentration of a mineral ion which is valuable to the plant is detected by the root, it extends lateral roots to absorb as much of the mineral as possible

Chemotropism
Included on the slide is an illustration of Chemotropism or the response of a plant
